<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
The Construction Tasks Ontology (CTO) describes tasks operating on construction elements, spatial zones and/or damages. 
The tasks are either planned or executed depending on the dataset metadata context of the dataset its used in. 
Five different types of tasks are defined: instalment, removal, modification, repair and inspection. 
Consequences of tasks on the dataset, i.e. added and/or deleted triples, are modeled using reified statements (RDF reification). 
The tasks can link to a reified statement using the CTO relations.

The CTO ontology was created by Mathias Bonduel (KU Leuven) during his PhD research (2017-2020) funded by the Research Foundation Flanders in the form of a Strategic Basic Research grant (grant agreement 1S65917N).
